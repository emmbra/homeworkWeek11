# Express Note Taker

## Description
Created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and saves/retrieves note data from a JSON file. In your terminal, navigate to the folder containing the app.js and the application can be invoked using the following commands:

npm i (to install all dependencies)

node .\app.js (to launch the application locally)

## Technologies

* node.js
    * express NPM
    * uuid NPM

## Challenges

In total this project took about 4 hours to build including all the time put into research and trial & error.

Difficulties included:

* express middleware. Without the express.static middleware I wasn't able to render my static information, but once I figured this out everything came together.
